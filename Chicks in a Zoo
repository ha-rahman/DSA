/*Initially, the zoo have a single chick. A chick gives birth to 2 chicks every day and the life expectancy of a chick is 6 days.
Zoo officials want to buy food for chicks so they want to know the number of chicks on an Nth day. Help the officials with this task.
Example 1:
Input: N = 2 
Output: 3
Explanation: First day there is only 1 chick.
On second day total number of chicks = 3.*/
